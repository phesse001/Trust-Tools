    "content": "Trust Tools . The fundamental components of trustworthy computational results are transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. . Transparency: . All data and software used to produce a result are available with sufficient documentation. . Reproducibility: . Results can be computed by someone else using the authorâ€™s environment. . Replicablilty: . Consistent results can be obtained using another environment. . Outline . In order to make our results trustworthy, this webpage attempts to cover all three points discussed above. We provide different solutions to the problem of reporducibility, each with varying degrees of success. . For each solution we provide a brief overview and an outline all of the required dependencies and steps to get started. Even further, we provide generalized templates that anyone can take and modify for their own needs. . We then show how these different solutions can be used by applying them to a March Madness Rating system. All of the data and source code for the March Madness Rating System are referenced as well. .",
